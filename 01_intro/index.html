#### Week 1: Introduction 

Hello World!

This is the first entry to my documentation to PS70. As all my previous PIs have emphasized on the criticalness of keeping records of everything you do. Here, I will document all my lab work, thought processes, project development cycles, as well as trials and errors for future review of myself and my peers.


Our primary assignment for this week is to develop this website using HTML/CSS. Without any past web development experience, this task was quite daunting to me. On top of that, I also missed the lab session on Friday due to schedule conflicts. It is not easy to learn this on my own. Text editing wasn’t too bad since I’ve had experience with Visual Studio Code, but sizing the images is particularly menacing. I didn’t know what codes to use so I had to crop the images to the intended sizes before posting them onto the web pages. Well, at least the website looks presentable now. As the course goes on, and I accumulate more experience working with HTML/CSS, I will continue to customize and update this website. It’s only the beginning of the journey.

Final Project Brainstorming:

As for my final project ideas, I’ve only come up with one so far. 

I wanted to build a (mini-version) prototype of a potential smart work desk. As the pandemic hits us hard in the past two years, it also creates a lasting change in the business landscapes and behaviors of work. More and more businesses are shifting to a work-from-home or at least a hybrid format. Most office workers don’t have designated work desks at home, so I think there is potential for a business venture. Some contextual secondary research:

More studies have shown that about 20 to 25 percent of the workforce in advanced economies could work from home between three and five days a week without loss of productivity. This represents four to five times more remote work than before the pandemic and could prompt a large change in the geography of work, as individuals and companies shift out of large cities into suburbs and small cities (1).

Office workers transitioning into working from home will likely start to get their own office equipment. Printers, photocopiers, and scanners are believed to be the bare essential business machines that every office worker cannot live without (2). The consumption of desktop printers, photocopiers, and scanners will likely increase in the next few years.

To fill this product opportunity gap, a convenient, comfortable, and multi-functional smart work desk can be developed for office workers who work from home or executives who have private offices.

Here is the concept art of the proposed work desk:

Of course, this is very elaborated, and I don’t think the final prototype can be developed in this timeframe (and frankly, I’m not sure if I have the skillsets to do so). However, I hypothesized that a mini version (both in sizes and functions) of the prototype with minimum viable features can still be achieved.

The features should include:
- Charging coils integrated into the desk surface that can enable wireless charging
- Adjustable parts
- Integrated charging ports and concealable power outlets
- Simple display (not sure how difficult it will be, could use a Raspberry Pi or something similar)
- Somewhat ergonomical
- Last but not least, because this counts as a smart appliance under the idea of IoT, it should have wireless connection capabilities (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi)


That’s all folks! (At least for now.) I’m still quite unsatisfied with what I can come up with at the current stage. I don’t want to limit myself to just one idea either. I will continue to add more brainstorming ideas here as I pick up more skills that open up more possibilities. Stay tuned.
