### About Me

Hello there!

You want to learn a little bit about me, I see. Well, Winter Zhang is my name. I'm a first-year graduate student from Brown University. I majored in NanoEngineering and Product Design for my undergraduate study and Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship for graduate study. Having a strong interest in IoT technologies, my career plan is to develop and commercialize Internet of Things ecosystems, hoping maybe one day I can turn some commercializable concepts into realities.

Having learned the background knowledge and the business side of things, I found myself lacking the practical hands-on skills in working with IoT devices. This will leave a gap in my career roadmap. I believe the training from Introduction to Digital Fabrication can help me fill this critical gap. I'm very excited to work with you all!

Fun fact about me: I once lost my glasses in the sea at Cape Cod. I magically retrieved them from the beach two days later. The glasses are completely worn out, but I keep them as a keepsake.

And a bonus fun fact if you want more: Up until the day I'm updating this bio (9/6/2022), I have lived in five different cities due to various circumstances. I've had my share of moving and I truly don't want any more (I know it's coming regardless, sigh).
