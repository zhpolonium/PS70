#### Week 8: CNC Milling, Molding & Casting <br>
<br>
This week, my learning objective focuses on CNC milling and molding&casting. <br>

#####<b>CNC </b>

For the test piece, I cut the upper symbol via standard cut with a depth less than the material thickness (to achieve etching), and the lower letter via pocket cut. The test piece was done mostly to test the resolution of the pocket cut and etching to prepare for the following project. As you can see, the letter and the symbol are clean and clear. This result gave me the confidence to include some finer details in the design.<br>

For the CNC project, I decided to make a tilt maze. We've all played these when we were kids, right? I had a ton of fun with them, so might as well recreate one. Plus, after witnessing the precision milling capability of CNC, I believe it's the ideal tool for this project. <br>

Because a large chuck of the surface had to be milled, the process took a long time. I had mixed feelings after seeing the end product. I was partly happy because it turned out very decent. It looked professionally made, like the ones from my childhood. The "floor" of the maze was very smooth and allowed the ball to move around wihout hinderance. But I was also quite disappointed because the edges were very rough and almost all of the fine details were either destroyed or almost destroyed. You can hardly find the smaller obstacles I put at the crossroads, and you can't really make out the starting point and the victory point in the maze. I don't blame the machine however, I blame the material. It was composite wood, after all, so the bit tends to cut the material by chunks. Fine features and smaller details are thus hard to achieve. If I were to do it again, I would certainly use better material. I'm sure with plywood planks or some other homogenous material, it'd have much better quality. <br>

<b>Be warned! Definitely not a toy for children, lots of splinters.</b>


#####<b>Molding & Casting </b>


As a coin collector, I thought it'd be cool make my own replicas of some of the rarer coins I stumbled upon. I chose to mold a particularly large half-dollar coin. I did encounter some obstacles very early on. Part A of the molding solution had solidified on its own, probably because it had passed its shelf life. So the mixture which was supposed to be as smooth as syrup, looked like some kind of blue oatmeal. Well, it did suggest "use as soon as possible after opening" on the label.

I tried the freshly opened ones the next day, and they worked like a charm. I molded the coin and left it to stand overnight.

<br>Here is the mold.


To make my replicas coin-like, I decided to use melted metal as cast. The metal melted nicely at 450F. I was a little worried that the liquified metal would burn the mold but the mold was very heat-resistant. 


I was very excited to take out the replica after it cooled down, but the end product was very disappointing. The replica had bubbles all over its surface and I could barely make out any details. I tried four more iterations, adjusting my pouring speed each time (faster and slower), but could never get the result I wanted.

<br>I decided to call this "moon coin", for obvious reasons.

<br>You can vaguely see a few letters but that's it.

<br>The edge is surprisingly good though.


The replicas have bubbles at different spots. That means the mold has nothing to do with the bubbles. The bubbles likely come from the liquefied metal itself. Perhaps some impurities casued different parts of the metal to melt and freeze at different points, leaving these air bubles behind. Anyway, that's not something I can fix on my own. Reluctantly, I left this project on a sad note. Maybe I will try some more controllable material in the future.
